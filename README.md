# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project is a simple HTTP server built using Node.js, which serves static files from a `public` directory as well as JavaScript files from a `src` directory. It is designed to handle requests for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON files.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash

   (Note: This project does not seem to require additional dependencies as the provided content does not indicate any from package.json.)

## Usage
To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```

Once the server is running, you can visit the following URLs in your web browser:
- **Home Page:** [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- **Main JS File:** [http://localhost:8000/src/main.js](http://localhost:8000/src/main.js)
- **Static Files:** Access any other static files inside the `public` directory at [http://localhost:8000/public/...](http://localhost:8000/public/...).

## Features
- Serves HTML files and static resources including CSS and JavaScript.
- Handles requests for files in a structured manner.
- Returns appropriate content types based on file extensions.
